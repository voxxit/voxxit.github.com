title: Trying Out Blogging Again
---

I think it has been far too long since I have shared my fully-developed thoughts with the Internet. With over [550 followers on Twitter](http://twitter.com/voxxit) and more on a number of other social networks, I think its safe to say I have an audience who are willing to listen. I think it is a wasted opportunity, and that is why I have decided to again add blogging to my personal web site.

One thing I did in the past that I won't be doing on this blog is having comments. Why bother? Twitter is perfect for short blurbs, and if I want to open up the discussion to a wider audience for more conversation, I can post to [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) for the big posts, like project launches and updates.

Want to know the coolest part?

I have decided to skip out on using a database, writing the blogging software and hosting the blog myself in lieu of using GitHub Pages and [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) for static pages. It is awesome, and I completely recommend it for my fellow hackers.

I'll leave you there for now. If you have any suggestions for me or my new blog, feel free to tweet me.
